# BookList
This is a simple Object-Oriented ES6 JavaScript book list application that allows the user to input a book title, author, and ISBN number. 

The user can add and remove books to and from the list. 

The application uses the browser's local storage to persist data. 

This project also includes an alternate app.js file that accomplishes the same objectives without ES6 classes (minus local storage utilization).

Project completed during Udemy course Modern Javascript From The Beginning.
